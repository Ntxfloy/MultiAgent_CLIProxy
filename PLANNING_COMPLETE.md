## Timeline

- **Week 1 (MVP):** CLI + worktrees + QA + security (40h)
- **Week 2-3 (V1):** State machine + recovery + fallback (80h)
- **Week 4 (Polish):** Tests + docs + optimization (40h)
- **Total:** 3-4 weeks (160 hours)

## Key Features After Upgrade

✅ Git worktree isolation (zero file conflicts)  
✅ Structured QA loop (50 iterations, JSON protocol)  
✅ Security (allowlist + validators)  
✅ State machine (phase tracking)  
✅ Crash recovery (checkpoint + resume)  
✅ Provider-agnostic (any OpenAI-compatible API)  
✅ Parallel execution (3-5 tasks)  
✅ Production-ready
